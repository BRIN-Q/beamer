# BRIN-Q Beamer Templates

This repository contains presentation templates for BRIN-Q researchers, especially those in the Quantum Matter Theory group.  Feel free to modify the templates.

The templates are best compiled in Overleaf or full TeXLive environment.

In Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions, you can install TeXLive with the following command:
```
sudo apt install texlive-full
```
