# BRIN-Q Beamer Templates

This repository contains presentation templates for BRIN-Q researchers, especially those in the Quantum Matter Theory group.  Feel free to modify the templates.

The templates are best compiled in Overleaf or full TeXLive environment.

In Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distributions, you can install TeXLive with the following command:
```
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

There are two flavors of the templates:
- `main-light.tex`: more suitable for formal seminars or conferences
- `main-dark.tex`: more suitable for teaching or small classes

Both flavors can be compiled with the usual `pdflatex` command:
```
pdflatex main-light.tex
```
or
```~
pdflatex main-dark.tex
```
